# Acceptance-test-feedback
small acceptance test, which tests the functionality of the feedback form.
It should work like this:

     If all fields are not filled in, the error message "Please fill all the fields."
     If the e-mail address does not have an @ symbol, the error message "Please check your e-mail address."
     If all fields are filled in correctly, the given information will be printed as follows. The ones in parentheses are information provided by the user (the parentheses are not part of the printout).
     Hello, (user)!
